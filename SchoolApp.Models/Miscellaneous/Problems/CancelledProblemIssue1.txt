/*
  Problem1:

     Your data model has a circular relationship:

     Admission references Classes through refClass.
     Classes references Student through refStudents.
     Student references Classes through Classses.
     This creates a loop where a change in one table couldtrigger cascading changes in the others, leading toinfinite recursion.


 Solution1: 
  Restructuring Relationships with an Intermediate Entity:

 Create an Enrollment entity with properties like EnrollmentId,StudentId, ClassId, and AdmissionId. Then:

 Modify Student and Classes to have a one-to-many relationshipwith Enrollment.
 Update Admission to reference Enrollment instead of Classes.
 This effectively breaks the circular dependency and providesfiner-grained control over student association with classes.
